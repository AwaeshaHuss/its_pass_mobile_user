## Current Task: Run Flutter App on TECNO KI5q Device

### Task Overview
The user wants to run the Flutter Uber clone app on their TECNO KI5q device connected via WiFi. This involved resolving multiple compatibility issues with modern Flutter/Android tooling.

### Progress
- [x] Check connected devices and verify TECNO KI5q is available
- [x] Fix Gradle/Java version compatibility issue (updated to Gradle 8.4)
- [x] Fix rounded_loading_button compilation error (removed unused dependency)
- [x] Upgrade Android Gradle Plugin to version 8.1.0+
- [x] Remove incompatible plugins (flutter_geofire, restart_app)
- [x] Update README.md with project status and fixes
- [ ] Run Flutter app on TECNO KI5q device (pending - ready for deployment)

### Lessons
- Successfully removed all Stripe payment integration from Flutter app
- Key files modified: pubspec.yaml, main.dart, global_var.dart, payment_dialog.dart
- Deleted stripe_payment_service.dart completely
- Updated PaymentDialog widget to show only cash payment option
- Added comprehensive unit tests for cash-only payment functionality
- Flutter analyze confirmed no Stripe-related errors remain
- Payment system now supports only cash payments as requested

### New Lessons from Device Deployment Task
- Gradle 8.4 is required for Java 21 compatibility (updated gradle-wrapper.properties)
- Android Gradle Plugin 8.1.0+ requires namespace declarations in plugin build.gradle files
- Some older Flutter plugins (flutter_geofire, restart_app) are incompatible with AGP 8.1.0+ due to missing namespace declarations
- rounded_loading_button package has API compatibility issues with current Flutter version (onSurface parameter removed)
- Temporary solution: Comment out incompatible plugin usage and remove dependencies until compatible alternatives are found
- Always update README.md to document compatibility fixes and temporarily disabled features
- TECNO KI5q device connects via WiFi at IP 192.168.0.125:5555
